# MarioNeuralNetworkGym

## Setup Guide

Install all requirements and matplotlib

To train the algorithms:
- run main.py for q-learning
- run ea.py for the combinatorial evolutionary algorithm (CEA)
- run ea-neural.py for the neat algorithm

To see a playback of the models (only q-learning and the CEA are available):
- run cea-playback.py for the CEA
- for q-learning, run q-learning-playback.py, but make sure to change the path to the model you want to see the playback from.

Lastly, all plots-\$algorithm\$.py files can be used to generate the plots
